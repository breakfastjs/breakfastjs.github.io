				<h1>Code of Conduct</h2>
				<h4 title="Too Long; Didn't Read: Basically what we're saying is...">TL;DR: Be excellent to one another, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkELFSaBnc0">great waffles stick together.</a></h4><br/>

				<h2>The short version</h2>
				<p>We, as organisers of BreakfastJS, are dedicated to providing an inclusive and 
				harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of age, sex, gender identity or
				expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
				size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of
				community members in any form.  Anyone attending a club or joining the community online who violates these rules will be asked to leave immediately without a refund or expelled from the community at the discretion of the organisers
				of BreakfastJS.
				</p>

				<h2>The less short version</h2>
				<p>
				Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender
				identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
				age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate
				intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
				sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
				and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
				for any events at BreakfastJS clubs or in any related
				communication channels including on Twitter, Instagram, Github & Facebook. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to
				the anti-harassment policy.

				We also have a general policy that we do not tolerate disruptive behaviour including repeated interruption, inebriation (or similar intoxication), fighting or open aggression.
				</p>

				<h2>What to do if you have a concern?</h2>
				<p>
				If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the organisers of
				BreakfastJS may take any action they deem appropriate, including
				warning the offender or expulsion from the community. If you are being
				harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns,
				please contact an organizer immediately.

				<p>
				The organisers of the above communities developed this Code of Conduct to
				govern their respective events and communication channels. We used [PDX
				Python's anti-harassment policy](http://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/pages/Code_of_Conduct/)
				and the [Geek Feminism Conference anti-harassment policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) and the [Nodeschool Code of Conduct Template](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/blob/master/codeofconduct-template.md)
				as a starting point.
